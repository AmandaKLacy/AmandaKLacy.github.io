# Amanda Lacy - PhD Student, Texas A&M University

## Section 1: About Me
**Name:** Amanda Lacy

**Why I am in this class:** I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Texas A&M University. I am taking this class to explore how software can better support communication and coordination for diverse users. As a congenitally blind individual on the autism spectrum, I am particularly interested in sensory substitution and the design of interfaces that respect cognitive load. My goal is to understand how we can create collaborative tools that are more accessible and less overwhelming for those with different sensory processing needs.

## Section 2: Collaborative Software I Use Regularly
* **Email:** This is my primary tool for academic and professional communication. I prefer its simplicity and the ability to navigate text line-by-line using keyboard commands.
* **iMessage and FaceTime:** I use these daily to keep in touch with my husband, Jason, and other friends and family.
* **GitHub:** I use this for version control and coordinating code for my research and PhD projects.
* **Zoom:** I use this for meetings with my advisor and peers, although I primarily use the audio and screen-sharing features.
* **Slack (iOS):** While I avoid it when possible, I use the iOS version for certain academic groups because it is significantly less cluttered than the desktop version.
* **MacOS Calendar:** I use this for scheduling meetings and coordinating my research timeline.

## Section 3: Reflection on Coordination Features
### What Helps the Most
The features that help me the most are those that maintain a **simple, predictable interface**. Email is the gold standard for me because it allows for granular control; I can review every single line someone typed at my own pace using keyboard commands. I also find the iOS version of Slack helpful compared to the desktop version because its simplified layout reduces the cognitive noise and makes navigation via VoiceOver more intuitive.

### What Could Be Better
Modern collaborative software often prioritizes "feature richness" over **focus management and text navigation**. 
* **Granular Review:** Many apps, like the Zoom chat or Slack, often present messages as a single, massive block of text. This is a significant barrier. For example, if an advisor sends a long message with multiple paragraphs in a Zoom chat, the screen reader reads the entire thing at once. If I have a question about a specific sentence in the middle, I cannot "arrow" back to that specific line to review it. 
* **Reducing Clutter:** Many tools are visually and structurally cluttered, which can be overwhelming and make it easy to get lost in the interface. 
* **Focus Control:** I would like to see tools that allow for better text isolation, enabling a screen reader user to navigate and review incoming chat messages with the same level of precision as a standard text document or email thread.
